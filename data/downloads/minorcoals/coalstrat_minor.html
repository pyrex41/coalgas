<dd>

Data files of non-confidential stratigraphic information for the Jamestown, Colchester, Seelyville, Dekoven, Lower Dekoven, and Davis Coals from over 12,000 drill hole and outcrop descriptions of Pennsylvanian stratigraphy.  Coordinates have been calculated for each point location.
<br/>
COALSTRAT_MINOR.TXT (ASCII text, comma-delimited) and COALSTRAT_MINOR.XLSX (Excel) are data files that contain one record per data point.  Data provided are ID, coordinates, well type, log type, surface elevation, and elevation and thickness of the three coals.
<br/>
IL_COAL_STRAT_MINOR_PT.SHP and related files are the GIS shapefile created from the data text file.  The native spatial reference of the data is unprojected Geographic Decimal Degree, NAD83.  See the shapefile's &quot;.prj&quot; file for more information.

This file is a subset of the ISGS Coal Section's Stratigraphic Database, an archive of stratigraphic data compiled by ISGS staff for various projects (primarily related to coal resources, structure, and mining geology) dating back to 1938.

</dd>
<dt><em>Purpose:</em>  
<dd>

These data were compiled for the National Coal Resources Data System (NCRDS) and the National Coal Assessment of the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS). The complete database is available from the USGS.  This file presents the thickness and elevation data on three of the most important coal seams in Illinois.  The data are useful for creating structure or isopachs of the coal seams to aid in exploration for coal, coalbed methane, or oil and gas.

Accuracy of attribute information is variable, depending on the source materials and the geologist. Some logs are precise measurements of thickness and depth, others may have errors or be rounded.  Geologic correlations are, of course, open to other interpretations.  In general: measurements from core descriptions and coal test geophysical logs are accurate to within fractions of an inch; measurements from drillers logs may be accurate to within an inch to 5 feet, depending on the equipment used and the experience of the on-site geologist; measurements from oil test geophysical logs are accurate to within +/- one foot.
<br/>
Formal evaluation tests have not been run, but daily hands-on experience using the data for real-life applications has proven the quality of the database.  Experience suggests that less than 1% of the data contain errors that involve gross mis-location of points or mis-correlation of coals.

The database was compiled by ISGS staff for various projects
(primarily related to coal resources, structure, and mining
geology) dating back to 1938.  This subset was compiled for
and is available from the USGS's National Coal Resources Data
System.  No attempt has been made to compile all available
data.  This file does not represent all the well records on
file at the ISGS, nor should the absence of data for one or
more coals for a specific data point be interpreted to mean
that those coals are not present.

Concerning the accuracy of horizontal coordinate measurements,
there is considerable variability depending on the source
material.  Some holes have surveyed locations and are accurate
to within a foot, others have only description to the nearest
forty acres.  Overall, the database administrator estimates that
most points are within 500 feet of their correct locations,
but no scientific tests have been done to verify this.

Initially, data are entered into a set of temporary
holding files.  A series of programs is then run to
convert certain fileds to numeric codes and to
calculate values for other fields.  Legal location
descriptions are converted to coordinates and a
program then determines in which quadrangle each point
is located.  Another program checks the database to see
if other descriptions of that point have been previously
entered.  If other descriptions are located, a version
number is assigned to the new description.

Following data entry and conversion to codes, a number of
programs are run to catch errors before before final loading
of new data into the database.  These programs catch most
errors made in compiling or encoding stratigraphic data.

The Coal Stratigraphic Data were extracted from the main
stratigraphic data base.  The criteria for extraction
individual points were that one or more of the three
coals had been correlated at a point, the precise location
of the point was known, and that the data were not proprietary.
